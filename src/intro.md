# Introduction
This book is the result of a set of notes that I've taken in my journey towards learning Rust as a Python developer. It is mainly aimed at helping other Python developers learn Rust. As such, it focuses on mapping Python concepts to Rust concepts, marking the most important differences along the way.

For in-depth explanations it links to the relevant parts of the excellent and free Rust documentation. The most notable sources are:
- the [*Rust Programming Language Book*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), which is the main introductory guide for people who wish to program in Rust.
- The [*Rust Reference*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/), which explains how Rust works with the maximum depth possible.
